                    A living nightmare, Omen takes full advantage of his shadowed physique and will not hesitate to eliminate his enemies using the forces of paranoia and fear. He is cynical in nature, which stems from him experiencing extreme pain as he was condemned to remain in the state that he is today. If there's one person who wants to know more about his mysterious circumstances, it's Omen himself - and quite desperately so.

                    <br>
                    Omen wears gray armor, black pants, and a purple hooded cape. His arms are wrapped in bandages while never revealing his form underneath. His face cannot be seen under his hood, with only three bright blue slits being present instead.
